# Variables and Methods

Variables and methods are two of the
fundamental building blocks of Ruby. Variables
are used to store data values for later use.
Methods, in essence, store application _behaviors_
(in code) that we can call on later. 

In this section are lessons and labs related to
variables and methods. Topics include:

* Variables assignment
* Using variables
* Defining and calling methods
* Default method arguments
* Method scope
* Mutability
